    <h1>Puzzled Pint Map</h1>
    <p>I built this map to make it easier to find <a href="https://puzzledpint.com/">Puzzled Pint</a> events near me.</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Select layers in the top right of the map.</p>
    <p>The "Cities" layer with circular markers is based on the locations list on the homepage. Red cities are defunct, yellow are in hiatus (described recently on the webpage without a live in-person event), and green are active.</p>
    <p>You can also view the locations of events for a particular month. Clicking on a pin gives more info. Some markers are yellow in case an exact location could not be found. Typically this means the city can't hold a live event that month.</p>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>This is still <a href="https://github.com/ndimov/puzzled-pint-map">under development</a>, and suggestions or improvements are welcome! Data may be out of date or incorrect, so please check the website to confirm.</p>
