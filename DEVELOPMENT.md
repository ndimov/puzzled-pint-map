# Todo
* Handle multiple locations listed under one city (e.g. San Francisco, Seattle)
* Mark locations with a temporary(?) hiatus with red markers on the map

# Notes

The Puzzled Pint website uses this Javascript code to render the locations: https://puzzledpint.com/wp-content/plugins/puzzled-pint-custom/public/js/location-info-legacy.js?ver=v1.3.0
